    <p><strong>What services do you provide?</strong><br>We provide professional truck dispatching services, including load sourcing, rate negotiation, carrier support, invoicing coordination, and ongoing operational assistance to help owner-operators and fleets stay profitable and compliant.</p>
    <p><strong>Which states do you operate in?</strong><br>All 48 continental U.S. states.</p>
    <p><strong>How are payments handled?</strong><br>Monthly billing for services already rendered.</p>
    <p><strong>What types of carriers do you work with?</strong><br>We work with owner-operators and small to mid-sized fleets operating box trucks, dry vans, reefers, and power-only units, depending on availability and market conditions.</p>
    <p><strong>Do you require a long-term contract?</strong><br>We sign a service agreement, but it is not binding. Carriers are free to cancel at any time, provided all pending dues are cleared.</p>
    <p><strong>How do you charge for dispatch services?</strong><br>We charge only for services rendered. Fees are clearly disclosed upfront and are typically based on a percentage of gross revenue or a flat agreed fee, depending on the service plan.</p>
    <p><strong>Are there any upfront or hidden fees?</strong><br>No. We do not charge hidden fees. Any applicable fees are discussed and agreed upon before services begin.</p>
    <p><strong>Do you handle factoring or payment setup?</strong><br>Yes. We can assist carriers with factoring company setup, payment workflows, and guidance on getting paid faster, though all factoring relationships remain between the carrier and the factoring provider.</p>
    <p><strong>Do you guarantee loads or income?</strong><br>No. While we work diligently to secure the best available loads and rates, we do not guarantee specific income, load frequency, or profit levels, as these depend on market conditions and carrier availability.</p>
    <p><strong>How do you communicate with carriers?</strong><br>We communicate via phone, email, and messaging platforms during business hours to ensure clear, timely updates on loads, paperwork, and daily operations.</p>
    <p><strong>Can I choose which loads to accept?</strong><br>Absolutely. You always have full control over which loads you accept or decline. We present options; the final decision is always yours.</p>
    <p><strong>What happens if I want to stop using your services?</strong><br>You may cancel at any time. Once all pending invoices or service fees are settled, your account will be closed with no further obligation.</p>
